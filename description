# Git-Chat Project

## Introduction
Git-Chat is a simple distributed chat application built using Git as the backend. Messages are shared between users by pushing and pulling commits to a central bare repository.

## Methods
1. A bare Git repository is used to manage chat messages.
2. Users clone the backend and use `git commit`, `git fetch`, and `git push` for communication.
3. Bash scripting is used to automate message handling.

## Results
- Multi-user communication via Git is functional.
- Chat logs are displayed with `git log`.
- Conflict handling is supported by Git's merge mechanism.

## Discussion
Git-Chat demonstrates the power of Git for distributed systems. Future improvements could include encryption, better UI formatting, and error handling.
