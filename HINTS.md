# Hints

## Project 1

### Implementation

Read the **TODO** annotations in `frontend/git-chat.sh`.

Also see the top-level `.gitignore` file.

These files should give you additional hints how to proceed
with the project. You are free to extend/adapt the project
as long as it results in a working app, acc. to its 
description in the README file from the Project and Training 
page.

The app shall be started/operated w/ `frontend/git-chat.sh <username>` 
from the project root, where `<username>` is the value of the
parameter `$1` in `git-chat.sh`

Good Luck!
