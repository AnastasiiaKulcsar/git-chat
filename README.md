# 🗨️ Git Chat

**Git Chat** is a lightweight terminal-based chat application designed to run directly within a Git environment. It leverages shell scripting and Git hooks to simulate a collaborative communication system — allowing users to chat, share updates, or trigger Git-related actions in real-time.

This project explores the creative intersection of Git workflows and real-time messaging.

## 💡 How It Works

* **Git Chat** uses **Git hooks** to detect repository actions and trigger chat-related scripts.
* Messages are handled through local **shell scripts**, which can be extended to broadcast or sync between users.
* It’s fully terminal-based — no GUI, just clean Bash logic.
* Ideal for learning Git internals, scripting, or experimenting with DevOps automation.
